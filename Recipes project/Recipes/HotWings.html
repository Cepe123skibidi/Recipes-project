        <h3>Are you craving some spicy goodness, if yes lets make some hot wings.</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Get chicken wings</li>
            <li>Cut off wing tip and seperate the drummet and flat with a  knife (you can also buy them pre-seperated)</li>
            <li>Get a bowl of flower</li>
            <li>Add some paprika, cayenne, and salt to your flower (most of the flavor will come form the buffalo sauce so dont overdo it)</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the flower over the wings</li>
            <li>Cover and leave in the fridge for about an hour</li>
            <li>While its in the fridge lets heat some vegetable oil to 375 on the stove</li>
            <li>For the sauce get a new bowl on the stove and add 2 sticks of butter</li>
            <li>Pour hot sauce on the butter (I recomend alot of hot sauce)</li>
            <li>Melt over low</li>
            <li>Add some garlic powder and black pepper (feel free to add whatever seasoning you want)</li>
            <li>Stir constantly and keep warm while we fry the wings</li>
            <li>Place small batches of wings in the oil (it should take about 10-15 minutes or till they're golden)</li>
            <li>Drain on paper towels before you toss them in the sauce</li>
            <li>Put the sauce you made on the wings</li>
            <li>Dont forget a nice cold drink to go with your wings</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now that we have made our wings its time to dig in. <strong>LETS GET MESSY!</strong></p>
